3 standard or default streams:
i) System.in : standard input stream, used to read characters from the keyboard or any other standard input device.

ii) System.out: standard output stream, used to produce the result of a program on screen.
various print functions used to output statements are:

i) print() : to print text on the console. This method prints the text on the console and the cursor reamins at the end of the text at the console.
the next printing takes place just from here.
o/p ex: hello! hello! hello!

ii)println(): used to display a text on the console. it prints the text on the console and the cursor moves to the start of the next line at the console.
the next printing takes from next line
o/p ex: hello !
        hello!

iii)printf(): similar to printf in c. upper 2 methods may take single arguments but this may tak multiple arguments. used to format the output in java.
sopln("x=%d%n",x);
; -> means the end of line . 
\n -> A\nB -> A will be print in one line and B in the next line .
